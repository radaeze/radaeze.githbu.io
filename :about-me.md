**Ramia Davis** was born in Los Angeles, CA and ever since has had a love/hate relationship with writing. Since graduating in 2018 from Mills College (the wokest womenâ€™s college in America) with a B.A. in English, she has been focusing on the intersections between literature and tech. Currently based in the Bay Area, she works as a technical writer and, on the side, as an interactive fiction creator.
