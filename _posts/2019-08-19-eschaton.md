**Eschaton** is a [Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_by_the_Apocalypse) hack set in a pre-apocalyptic world.
During the course of play, characters reckon with the apocalypse over a series of generations.
The original draft for Eschaton,
[Children of Revelations](https://radaeze.itch.io/children-of-revelations) was written in three weeks
for the [Legacy Jam](https://itch.io/jam/legacy-jam). Eschaton is a work in progress and is currently
going through play-testing.
